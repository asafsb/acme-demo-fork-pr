This folder needs to exist for env0 to properly configure the "working directory" to run the tf code from.
The contents of this folder gets generated from the env0.yml call to `cdktf synth -o template`

Either configure env0 template to point to the resulting synth location e.g. `template/stacks/s3` or 
use chdir flag in Terraform TF_CLI_ARGS="-chdir=temlate/stacks/s3"
